## Testing with Postman

### Importing an API specification

You can import a specification of our API directly into Postman. Follow this guide on [Importing an API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/#importing-api-definitions). The link to the API specification you will require are listed below.

- V2 - https://api.casefunnel.io/docs/funnel-v2.json
- V1 - https://api.casefunnel.io/docs/funnel-v1.json

### Importing a Postman collection

Alternatively you can import one of the following JSON Postman collection files. Follow this guide on [Importing a collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-postman-data). Please be aware that these files may become stale, using the method above is a sure fire way to import the latest specification of our APIs.
